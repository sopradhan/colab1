LokSwasthya AI - Agentic Platform for Livestock, Food Safety, and Human Health in India
In India, the safety and nutritional quality of food—across livestock, dairy, grains, staples, vegetables, and fruits—directly influence public health and economic stability. Yet, current monitoring and risk management are fragmented. Government agencies like ICAR and FSSAI maintain excellent reference databases and periodically release advisories and recalls. However, these systems often lack seamless integration with market-level data, batch sales records, field sensor and lab readings, real-time consumer complaints, and fast, actionable links to state health authorities. LokSwasthya AI addresses these gaps with agentic intelligence—a network of cloud-hosted autonomous microservices (“agents”) that actively ingest, harmonize, and analyze real-time data from all major food safety stakeholders:
Government Databases: Instant ingest from ICAR, FSSAI, and state portals, including standards, thresholds, recall lists, banned substances, outbreak reports, and region-wise nutrition recommendations.

Market & Vendor Records: Ongoing batch uploads, API connectivity, and event-driven data capture from market sales, vendor inventories, product codes, and cooperative platforms.

Lab & Sensor Streams: Direct integration with portable labs and IoT sensors generates readings for critical minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg, Zn, K, Na, Cu, Se, P, I, Mn), toxins (aflatoxins, pesticides, heavy metals), pathogens (Brucella, FMDV, BlueTongue, Avian Influenza), freshness, and spoilage markers.

Survey & App-based Feedback: Automated collection and linkage of consumer/vendor health complaints and symptoms via mobile forms, voice logs, and rapid survey modules.

Environmental Feeds: Continuous monitoring of weather, flood, pollution, and environmental risk, tied to region and season.

Image Data: Mobile photo uploads from vendors, farmers, labs, and field staff capture batch images, labeling, packaging, and visible signals of contamination, pest, spoilage, and animal disease.

Multimodal AI & Model Suite
The Multimodal ML Hub is a major technical innovation in LokSwasthya AI, where agents orchestrate specialized models for each prediction type:

Tabular Models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and custom regression/classifiers for structured batch and lab data—detecting mineral deficiencies, toxins, adulteration, and disease probabilities.

Sensor Models: LSTM, GRU, regression and time-series architectures interpret IoT sensor/freshness/spoilage data, environmental factors, and dynamic risk signals.

NLP/Text Models: Lightweight Transformers (DistilBERT, MobileBERT) interpret surveys, complaints, health advisories, vendor feedback, and regulatory updates—enabling sentiment analysis, early event detection, and symptom linking.

Image Models (Detectron2): Using Meta AI’s Detectron2, agents perform advanced image detection, segmentation, and labeling. Detectron2 identifies contamination, spoilage, pest/rodent activity, visible disease, and packaging errors from batch photo submissions. Image outputs are fused with tabular and sensor analysis for holistic prediction. Models run on cloud GPU, and ONNX/TensorRT exports support edge inference for mobile deployments where feasible.

Fusion Models: Agent-fused networks combine tabular, sensor, image, and text features for batch-level and consumer-level risk prediction—ensuring maximum context and accuracy. RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) modules fetch continuous government advisories, recalls, and outbreak news, automating contextual updates.

Agent Orchestration & Technical Pipeline
At its core, LokSwasthya AI leverages the Agent Orchestrator—a component that listens and responds intelligently to new market batches, lab findings, government alerts, or citizen feedback:

Workflow Management: Agents are assigned to food groups (e.g., livestock, dairy, grains), regions, vendor groups, or outbreak risks. Upon receiving new data or triggers, agents plan appropriate analytics, select predictive models, fetch relevant government recalls, and notify stakeholders.

Data Harmonization & Policy Integration: Diverse data types are automatically normalized and mapped against current thresholds, recall lists, and outbreak advisories.

Scheduling & Monitoring: Agents schedule health checks, batch analyses, region-wide rapid responses, and ongoing market surveillance based on state health department triggers, recall notices, or vendor request cycles.

Prediction, Alerts & Stakeholder Engagement
LokSwasthya AI goes beyond dashboards, driving real-world alerts and interventions:

Vendors and Farmers: Mobile app notifications and dashboards deliver rapid advisories (“Milk batch flagged for Brucella, recall required”; “Wheat sample exceeds aflatoxin threshold—remove from market”.State/Regional Health Departments: Direct notification pipeline ensures real-time batch/event alerts, outbreak detection, and containment actions—transforming public health response from reactive to proactive.Consumers: Risk ratings and health feedback close the loop between consumption, quality, and health outcomes. Automated advisories empower citizens with safe purchasing decisions .Regulatory Authorities: Automated audit logs and compliance reports document recalls, withdrawals, advisories, and citizen-facing actions—ensuring policy-driven, explainable interventions.

Expected Outcomes & Societal Impact
LokSwasthya AI delivers measurable, transformative benefits:

It proactively matches bench talent to internal gigs, roles, and mentorships, cutting idle time, boosting utilization, and improving retention. Predictive analytics forecast demand and recommend reskilling, turning bench time into deliverable value while giving employees transparent, personalized career mobility.


The platform builds a real‑time, organization‑wide skills graph from HRIS/LMS data, resumes, certifications, and project histories. An AI matching engine ranks candidates for each role using multi‑objective optimization (skills fit, availability, aspirations, location/time‑zone, rate/band, diversity goals). Employees get a personalized internal “job board” for short gigs and full roles; managers get instant shortlists; workforce planners get demand forecasts and upskilling recommendations. Result: fewer bench days, faster staffing, lower external hiring, and higher employee engagement—with governance, explainability, and bias monitoring built in.

Challenge/Business opportunity being addressed and the ability to scale it across TCS and multiple customers.
The challenge & opportunity: • Under utilization & margin drag: Manual staffing leaves capable people idle; utilization swings with project demand. • Fragmented talent data: Skills live across HRIS, ATS, LMS, resumes, and wikis—no single, current view. • Slow time to staff: Managers wait on recruiters while internal talent is available now. • Leaky retention: Lack of internal mobility visibility drives attrition and external hiring costs. • Strategic planning gap: Limited ability to forecast demand and proactively reskill or redeploy. Proposed solution : 1. Real Time Skills Inventory: Auto extract and normalize skills, certifications, and project histories into a continuously updated skills graph. 2. AI Driven Matching: Rank candidates for each role/gig using embeddings + rules + optimization. 3. Employee Marketplace: Personalized feed of roles, short term gigs, and mentorships aligned to skills and aspirations. 4. Manager & PM Console: Instant internal shortlists, one click requests, “what if” staffing scenarios. 5. Workforce Forecasting: Predict role demand and skills gaps; auto recommend reskilling cohorts and learning paths. 6. Governance & Analytics: Explainable recommendations, fairness/bias dashboards, utilization and time to staff KPIs.
Novelty of the idea, benefits and risks.
What’s innovative: • Real time skills graph that fuses structured + unstructured signals (projects, code repos, tickets, certifications). • Intent aware matching: blends skills with aspirations and learning goals to avoid “utilization at any cost.” • Proactive supply–demand engine: predicts needs and recommends reskilling before gaps appear. • Explainable, controllable AI: tunable weights, “why this match” breakdowns, and fairness constraints. Benefits: • Reduced idle time: Bench talent routed to work fast. • Productivity & delivery: Better skill–role fit → fewer delays, higher quality. • Cost optimization: Internal mobility cuts recruiting fees and contractor spend. • Retention & growth: Clear internal paths, short gigs for stretch opportunities. • Strategic agility: Rapid redeployment when priorities change. Scalability & sustainable value: • Technical scale: Stateless microservices, vector search (ANN), streaming updates; scales to tens of thousands of profiles. • Org scale: Designed for multiple BUs, geos, and languages; policy packs per region. • Data network effects: Each match/feedback improves the skills graph and ranking over time. • Sustained ROI: Ongoing reduction in bench + smarter reskilling yields compounding value. Illustrative ROI (example—adjust to your org): • Headcount: 2,000, bench rate 12%, ~230 workdays/year → baseline bench days = 2,000 × 0.12 × 230 = 55,200. • Conservative improvement: 35% reduction in bench days → 19,320 days saved. • Fully loaded daily cost: $550 → $10.626M gross savings/year. • If platform cost = $0.6M, net savings ≈ $10.026M; ~17.7× ROI in year one.
Highlight adherence to Responsible AI principles such as Security, Fairness, Privacy & Legal compliance.
Security & privacy by design: • Data minimization & purpose binding: Only ingest fields required for matching/forecasting; configurable retention. • Encryption: In transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES 256); secrets in a vault; KMS managed keys. • Access controls: SSO (SAML/OIDC), RBAC/ABAC with least privilege; manager sees only their span. • Segmentation & logging: VPC/private subnets; immutable audit logs; anomaly alerts for unusual access. • PII protection: Pseudonymize before embedding; redact sensitive text; optional on prem/vector DB. • Data residency & compliance: Region pinning; DPA readiness; GDPR/CCPA request workflows (access, rectify, erase). Responsible AI & governance: • Fairness: Track selection rate parity and disparate impact; enforce constraints in ranking to ensure equitable opportunity distribution. • Explainability & recourse: “Why this match” panels (top skills, evidence) + appeal/feedback flows for employees and managers. • Human in the loop: Managers approve final staffing; models assist, never auto decide high impact outcomes. • Bias controls: Exclude protected attributes and strong proxies from features; continuously test outcomes for drift/bias. • Model lifecycle: Versioned models, A/B tests, performance and drift monitors, rollback/kill switch. • Content safety: Prompt hardening; input/output filtering to avoid leaking sensitive data in free text fields.

API Endpoints enable integration with external grid management software (utility SCADA, energy apps), web dashboards, and mobile notifications.

Example Workflow
Grid Monitoring Agent continuously ingests data from SCADA API; time-series model predicts a risk of congestion at substation X.

Consumption Analysis Agent pulls the latest city-level demand data from NPP via REST API; forecast shows demand spike tomorrow.

Scenario Simulation Agent fetches weather predictions; models impact on solar/wind generation.

Log Analysis Agent parses maintenance logs uploaded via API, flags repeated outages on a transformer.

Orchestration Agent runs fusion model, compiles all insights, recommends optimal load balancing actions, triggers notifications via dashboard and webhook API

In power grid operations, restoration refers to the process of returning the electrical system—or part of it—back to normal functioning after a disturbance such as an outage, fault, or abnormal event.

Restoration in a Power Grid Context
When is restoration needed?

After a partial or complete blackout (loss of power supply)

Following faults in transmission lines, substations, or equipment (e.g., tripped breakers, short circuits, voltage sags)

Post-maintenance or emergency shutdowns

Key Restoration Steps (Often Automated by SCADA Agents):
Fault Isolation:

Agents identify and isolate the faulty section to prevent damage and minimize impact (e.g., opening breakers, rerouting power).

Reconfiguration:

The system redirects electricity flow around the fault, using backup lines or alternate substations to restore service to as many areas as possible.

Gradual Re-Energization:

Power is restored step by step to affected sections, preventing overloads or further faults.

Monitoring & Verification:

The agent or operator monitors voltages, currents, and system stability while restoring to ensure safe operation.

Full Restoration:

Once stability is validated, normal configuration and power delivery to all affected customers is resumed.

Logging & Reporting:

Every action is recorded for compliance, engineering analysis, and regulatory review.

SCADA Agent Role in Restoration
Detects the fault automatically.

Rapidly isolates it (opens breakers, switches lines).

Suggests/executes restoration steps—either automatically or with operator approval.

Ensures safe reconnection and records all events.

Challenge/Business opportunity being addressed and the ability to scale it across TCS and multiple customers.
India’s power grid faces chronic challenges: unpredictable demand surges, regional supply-demand mismatches, delayed fault detection, inefficient manual interventions, and increasing complexity due to renewables and distributed energy resources. Traditional approaches struggle to provide real-time, actionable intelligence for grid operators, utilities, policy makers, and large commercial consumers—leading to blackouts, losses, and operational inefficiencies. ShaktiSarathi AI enables automated monitoring, forecasting, and optimization of national power consumption by harnessing real-time data from SCADA, smart meters, weather feeds, and governmental platforms. Autonomous agents analyze these inputs, detect anomalies, predict peak loads, and recommend dynamic adjustments—such as grid reconfiguration, load balancing, and preventive asset maintenance. The solution's modular, API-driven architecture allows rapid scale-up across TCS business verticals, utility partners, smart city projects, state electricity boards, and industry customers. It integrates seamlessly with existing grid management software and IoT deployments, supports cloud or on-premise rollout, and adapts easily to evolving regulatory, market, or technical needs. ShaktiSarathi AI can be piloted for a city, expanded to a state, and scaled nationally—maximizing value for TCS and a diverse set of enterprise clients
Novelty of the idea, benefits and risks.
Novelty: ShaktiSarathi AI is one of the first platforms in India to fuse real-time grid data (SCADA, smart meters, weather, government reports) with agentic AI—enabling autonomous prediction, anomaly detection, and optimization of power consumption. The system leverages multimodal models—tabular, time-series, NLP, and fusion—within self-orchestrating agents that automate monitoring, forecasting, and actionable recommendations across the grid. This approach moves beyond traditional static dashboards and manual analysis; it provides dynamic, adaptive intelligence for all stakeholders in the power sector. Benefits: Delivers early warning for peak demand, system anomalies, and asset risks—allowing rapid intervention and improved grid reliability. Automates load balancing, preventive maintenance, and demand response—reducing blackouts, losses, and operational costs. Informs regulatory agencies, utilities, and consumers with transparent, evidence-driven insights—supporting policy and sustainable energy use. Scales quickly for TCS, state utilities, cities, and industries—enhancing efficiency and resilience at local and national levels. Risks: Data latency or completeness issues may limit short-term prediction accuracy; mitigated by data redundancy, validation, and agent error-handling. Privacy and security concerns for consumer/utility usage data are managed by robust encryption, anonymization, and access control. Evolving grid technologies and regulatory changes require adaptive agents and continuous system update.

LokSwasthya AI - Agentic Platform for Livestock, Food Safety, and Human Health in India
In India, the safety and nutritional quality of food—across livestock, dairy, grains, staples, vegetables, and fruits—directly influence public health and economic stability. Yet, current monitoring and risk management are fragmented. Government agencies like ICAR and FSSAI maintain excellent reference databases and periodically release advisories and recalls. However, these systems often lack seamless integration with market-level data, batch sales records, field sensor and lab readings, real-time consumer complaints, and fast, actionable links to state health authorities. LokSwasthya AI addresses these gaps with agentic intelligence—a network of cloud-hosted autonomous microservices (“agents”) that actively ingest, harmonize, and analyze real-time data from all major food safety stakeholders:
Government Databases: Instant ingest from ICAR, FSSAI, and state portals, including standards, thresholds, recall lists, banned substances, outbreak reports, and region-wise nutrition recommendations.

Market & Vendor Records: Ongoing batch uploads, API connectivity, and event-driven data capture from market sales, vendor inventories, product codes, and cooperative platforms.

Lab & Sensor Streams: Direct integration with portable labs and IoT sensors generates readings for critical minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg, Zn, K, Na, Cu, Se, P, I, Mn), toxins (aflatoxins, pesticides, heavy metals), pathogens (Brucella, FMDV, BlueTongue, Avian Influenza), freshness, and spoilage markers.

Survey & App-based Feedback: Automated collection and linkage of consumer/vendor health complaints and symptoms via mobile forms, voice logs, and rapid survey modules.

Environmental Feeds: Continuous monitoring of weather, flood, pollution, and environmental risk, tied to region and season.

Image Data: Mobile photo uploads from vendors, farmers, labs, and field staff capture batch images, labeling, packaging, and visible signals of contamination, pest, spoilage, and animal disease.

Multimodal AI & Model Suite
The Multimodal ML Hub is a major technical innovation in LokSwasthya AI, where agents orchestrate specialized models for each prediction type:

Tabular Models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and custom regression/classifiers for structured batch and lab data—detecting mineral deficiencies, toxins, adulteration, and disease probabilities.

Sensor Models: LSTM, GRU, regression and time-series architectures interpret IoT sensor/freshness/spoilage data, environmental factors, and dynamic risk signals.

NLP/Text Models: Lightweight Transformers (DistilBERT, MobileBERT) interpret surveys, complaints, health advisories, vendor feedback, and regulatory updates—enabling sentiment analysis, early event detection, and symptom linking.

Image Models (Detectron2): Using Meta AI’s Detectron2, agents perform advanced image detection, segmentation, and labeling. Detectron2 identifies contamination, spoilage, pest/rodent activity, visible disease, and packaging errors from batch photo submissions. Image outputs are fused with tabular and sensor analysis for holistic prediction. Models run on cloud GPU, and ONNX/TensorRT exports support edge inference for mobile deployments where feasible.

Fusion Models: Agent-fused networks combine tabular, sensor, image, and text features for batch-level and consumer-level risk prediction—ensuring maximum context and accuracy. RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) modules fetch continuous government advisories, recalls, and outbreak news, automating contextual updates.

Agent Orchestration & Technical Pipeline
At its core, LokSwasthya AI leverages the Agent Orchestrator—a component that listens and responds intelligently to new market batches, lab findings, government alerts, or citizen feedback:

Workflow Management: Agents are assigned to food groups (e.g., livestock, dairy, grains), regions, vendor groups, or outbreak risks. Upon receiving new data or triggers, agents plan appropriate analytics, select predictive models, fetch relevant government recalls, and notify stakeholders.

Data Harmonization & Policy Integration: Diverse data types are automatically normalized and mapped against current thresholds, recall lists, and outbreak advisories.

Scheduling & Monitoring: Agents schedule health checks, batch analyses, region-wide rapid responses, and ongoing market surveillance based on state health department triggers, recall notices, or vendor request cycles.

Prediction, Alerts & Stakeholder Engagement
LokSwasthya AI goes beyond dashboards, driving real-world alerts and interventions:

Vendors and Farmers: Mobile app notifications and dashboards deliver rapid advisories (“Milk batch flagged for Brucella, recall required”; “Wheat sample exceeds aflatoxin threshold—remove from market”.State/Regional Health Departments: Direct notification pipeline ensures real-time batch/event alerts, outbreak detection, and containment actions—transforming public health response from reactive to proactive.Consumers: Risk ratings and health feedback close the loop between consumption, quality, and health outcomes. Automated advisories empower citizens with safe purchasing decisions .Regulatory Authorities: Automated audit logs and compliance reports document recalls, withdrawals, advisories, and citizen-facing actions—ensuring policy-driven, explainable interventions.

Expected Outcomes & Societal Impact
LokSwasthya AI delivers measurable, transformative benefits:

Rapid Notification: Reduces time from contamination detection to advisories for vendors, regulators, and citizens.

Outbreak Detection & Containment: Automates evidence flows to state health departments, enabling swift response and minimized spread.

Lower Foodborne Illness & Malnutrition: Continuous monitoring and analytic intervention decrease incidence rates and support population health.

Trustworthy Food Ecosystem: Transparent, data-driven advisories rebuild stakeholder trust and support economic resilience for farmers, vendors, and markets.

Scalable AI Infrastructure: Enables TCS and customers to deploy robust, high-impact health analytics locally, regionally, or nationwide.

Challenge/Business opportunity being addressed and the ability to scale it across TCS and multiple customers.
India’s food supply chain faces persistent challenges: fragmented monitoring across markets and geographies, slow and reactive detection of contamination/adulteration, delayed outbreak and recall responses, and minimal linkage between consumer health feedback, vendor actions, and government interventions. These bottlenecks result in preventable public health risks, economic loss for producers and markets, and eroded trust in food safety. LokSwasthya AI addresses these gaps by automating the ingestion, integration, and analysis of diverse data sources—including government databases (ICAR, FSSAI, state or national health alerts), lab and sensor findings, vendor/market records, and real-time citizen feedback. Through agentic AI and multimodal analytics (tabular, image/Detectron2, sensor, NLP), the platform generates actionable health risk scores, batch-level contamination predictions, and rapid advisories for intervention—enabling swift responses to emerging threats. Scalability Across TCS and Customers: LokSwasthya AI’s modular, microservice architecture means rapid deployment in local co-operatives, markets, agribusiness sites, or state agencies. APIs and connectors support integration with TCS verticals (AgriTech, Healthcare, Retail, Analytics) and can extend to large enterprise clients, regulatory bodies, and rural digitization initiatives. The system grows by adding agents for new regions, food categories, and analytics, with ability to tailor dashboards, notification systems, and compliance reporting to any client ecosystem. Supports on-prem, cloud, or hybrid deployments; scalable from pilot projects to pan-India public health infrastructure, maximizing impact for TCS and diverse customer needs.

Autonomous agents orchestrate synchronous ingestion and harmonization of data from government databases, market and lab records, citizen feedback, and environmental APIs. The platform dynamically incorporates latest state advisories and recall events, triggering rapid, evidence-based alerts and interventions. Seamless integration with state health departments allows for closed-loop outbreak prevention, recall management, and citizen protection from the batch to the population level. Benefits: Enables early, automated detection and response to food contamination, disease, and nutrition risks. Empowers farmers, vendors, and consumers with clear, actionable advisories for quick intervention. Improves transparency and trust across food supply chains and markets. Reduces manual effort, improves coverage in rural and urban settings, and helps government respond rapidly to emerging public health threats. Continually learns and adapts to new challenges or foods, future-proofing safety and compliance. Risks: Incomplete, delayed, or inaccurate data ingestion may temporarily reduce prediction accuracy; mitigated by robust validating, fallback logic, and human-in-the-loop review. Potential bias in models or data representation handled by regular fairness audits and community-driven data expansion. Privacy and security challenges are managed by strict encryption, anonymization, and compliance with Indian data privacy laws. Integration failures with external APIs or government infrastructure are addressed by backup sync processes and modular design.
Highlight adherence to Responsible AI principles such as Security, Fairness, Privacy & Legal compliance.
LokSwasthya AI has been architected with Responsible AI at its core to ensure trust, safety, and accountability across all platform operations: Security: All data flows—government, market, lab, sensor, and user feedback—are encrypted at rest and in transit. Role-based access controls prevent unauthorized data retrieval and agent actions. Automated audit logs track every prediction, alert, and intervention, supporting end-to-end traceability and incident investigation. Fairness: Routine fairness and bias audits are performed on all deployed models to ensure predictions and advisories serve all regions, food groups, and communities equitably. Data collection strategies actively include underrepresented areas and groups; community feedback is incorporated to reduce systemic bias. Privacy: No personal identification data is stored or exposed; consumer and vendor feedback is anonymized before analytics. Full opt-in consent is required for all data sources, including citizen reporting and mobile app usage. Privacy controls and data minimization are implemented per Indian digital health laws and upcoming global standards. Legal Compliance: Platform enforces compliance with FSSAI, ICAR, and state food/health regulations for every recall, advisory, and report.
